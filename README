XLColorScrollView is a fancy view which is used in Resistor (iTunes Link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/resistor/id474536047?mt=8). It's a subclass of UIScrollView, and is a smart way to let user to select something through colors.

Instructions:
1. Add XLColorScrollView.h and XLColorScrollView.m into your own project.
2. Write code to add XLScrollView as a subview of your current view;
3. Implement UIScrollView delegate methods.

Tip:
1. Adjust verticalAnchorOffset when initializing in order to make the inner picture of colors appear at the right place.

Future of this project:
1. The picture of colors will be replaced with real time drawing.
2. AppKit version is coming soon.
